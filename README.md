# Useful Nuke
Hello there, I have decided to make a little code that makes the nuke useful

After playing a lot of Cold War few months ago where the perk machine points changes, it got me thinking when it came to using the nuke powerup and made me realize how useless nuke really was.

Now everytime someone picks up a nuke, everyone gets a few points PER zombie killed (along with the bonus 400 of course)
Is this alot of points? Yes. But I think you deserve a bit of a reward for picking up the nuke damnit!

## Configuration
This mod contains a few configurable options!

```set value #```

``usefulnuke_points`` - Amount of points each player gets per zombie killed - Default: 60

## Installation
Download usefuknuke.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using usefulnuke_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
